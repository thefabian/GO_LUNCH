              <p>
                The bigger the company, the less we know what is going on in departments outside of our own sphere. It’s simple to settle for the status quo – lunch with the same people, or worse, the very sad lunch at your desk. We communicate with the same people, have lunch with the same people, and talk to the same people every day. The result?  A lack of knowledge exchange and friendship between departments, which often times leads to a “silo mentality” and can block the flow of innovation. Regular casual meetings will improve the communication between departments and might lead to new collaborations and projects. And, last but not least, you can meet new people! Who knows? You might even meet your new best friend!

                Besides the general advantage of getting to know other colleagues and make new friends, Luncher will offer support to us on challenges we are currently facing. How? Well, here are a few examples:
              </p>
              <p>
                The best ideas emerge when different perspectives are shared. Open-ended discussions between employees from different departments and hierarchy levels provide a good platform for the development of creative thoughts. Meeting new people helps us understand each other better and expands our horizons – Luncher can offer us a way to connect, learn, and grow from one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                For new employees, it can be intimidating to start anew in a new place. We’ve all been there before.  Not only is it  important to establish a network quickly within the company, it’s essential to have an understanding of the responsibilities and challenges of different departments. Better cross-department understanding is an essential part of a successful integration. The benefits of Luncher aren’t limited to professional development – it’s also designed to help us meet new people in the hopes of turning acquaintances into friends.,  New  jobs are often accompanied with relocation to a new city. The social aspect of life like making friends and acquaintances has to be completely rebuilt in a brand new place. With Luncher meeting new people on a regular basis (i.e. over lunch or for an after-work beer) can help make that process a little less scary.

                You can schedule a lunch on your personal dashboard when you are logged in. Click on the button 'Schedule Luncher' and select a date and location. On the date of your blind lunch you will be matched with a colleague. You can check this out on your dashboard, his or her photo will appear on the scheduled lunch icon. You should then get in touch and discuss where and when to meet.
